      <br>Hello! Welcome to my Tutorial website where you can gain new skills, practice and or inspire. To get to know about my artworks I am a year 13 student in my last year of Highschool. I have decided to create this website to help encourage students (or anyone who has a passion for art.) I plan to succeed in this goal by showing others what I was able to achieve throughout my years of highschool. Some of my work is from year 9 and some work I have just accomplished recently. I have tried many different techniques and have learnt what works best for me and I hope that you can also figure out what works best for you. If you liked the kind of work I produce I have made a tutorial page where I have videos of me demonstrating different techniques you can attempt and also some of my most basic drawings so you can gain some of the knowledge I know about drawing. But don't forget! there is no limit to how you can draw. Use techniques that work best for you and HAVE FUN! Art is about expressing yourself.
